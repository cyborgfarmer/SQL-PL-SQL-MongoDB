/* This query pulls the quantity of produce (in pounds) 
donated to any specified pantry. It will likely be the 
case that it is best to use one standard unit of 
measurement, such as pounds, rather than including 
ounces and such as well. Even though this may be 
slightly more challenging on the data entry side of the 
operation, it will prove much easier to discover this 
kind of information. */
